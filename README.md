# CitiBike_Challenge

## Overview

Citibike is a large bike sharing company that spans across Brooklyn, Manhattan, Jersey City, Queens, and Hoboken. They have 25,000 bikes that one can opt to use as a more affordable mode of transportation than taxis and subways. Also, using Citibike eleminates the hassle of owning a bike.

Kate is a tourist visiting NewYork. She used Citibike while in New York and was amazed at how much money she saved using bikesharing over subbways and taxis. She also noted how much time she saved by not having to worry about traffic. Her experience with Citibike prompted her to reach out to an investor of Citibike and try to convince them to launch a similar program in her home town of Des Moines.

Before deciding on whther to invest in Des Moines we will present a better look at the data using the public data available from Citibike and analyze it with Tableau.

## Results

We have recieved the data in the form of a CSV file. It includes data for the month of August. 2.3 million records with information about the ride duratio, start point, and end point. Basic demographics such as gender and age are also included, but no financial data is included.

The Tableau generated worksheets are below:

## Summary

After sorting through the data and visualizing it with Tablesu we can clearly see that CitiBike is a great investment for New York City. However, will it be as successful in Des Moines?

The population difference between the two cities is significantly different. New York City has a population of 8,253,213 while Des Moines has a population of just 212,312. That makes the New York City population roughly 40 times bigger than Des Moines population. Based on the data above we can see that New York City has about 2.3 million rides per month. If we apply the same math to Des Moines we are only looking at about 60,305 rides per month. 

Another thing to consider is the size comparison of the two cities. Des Moines is much smaller making commute times more manageble than New York. This would make the demand for bikeshariong less. People in Des Moines may not have the need or save much money on alternatives modes of transportation due to shorter commute times.
