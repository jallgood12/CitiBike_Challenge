# CitiBike_Challenge

## Overview

Citibike is a large bike sharing company that spans across Brooklyn, Manhattan, Jersey City, Queens, and Hoboken. They have 25,000 bikes that one can opt to use as a more affordable mode of transportation than taxis and subways. Also, using Citibike eleminates the hassle of owning a bike.

Kate is a tourist visiting NewYork. She used Citibike while in New York and was amazed at how much money she saved using bikesharing over subbways and taxis. She also noted how much time she saved by not having to worry about traffic. Her experience with Citibike prompted her to reach out to an investor of Citibike and try to convince them to launch a similar program in her home town of Des Moines.

Before deciding on whther to invest in Des Moines we will present a better look at the data using the public data available from Citibike and analyze it with Tableau.
